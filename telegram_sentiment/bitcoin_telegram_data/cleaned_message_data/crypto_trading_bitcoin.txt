Due to the current instability in the market, investing in altcoins at the moment bears very high risk. Therefore, we recommend to wait until the market stabilizes, as BTC could do some real damage to altcoins in the next weeks.We don't want to gamble with our money by investing in this bleeding altcoin market right now. So we will take a break for now and not make any calls until the situation brightens up. This means you can also take some time off trading until we see the trend reverse. *We might still make occasional recommendations if we see a good opportunity. But please bear in mind that in the coming weeks, all signals will be very high risk. If you follow any signals, be sure to use risk management stategies.

üö©**S C A M   Alert** üö©Hello my dear friends, I wanted to post this from a long timeBcoz I see a lot of Scam Projects are coming up with the name of DeFi and NFTI have researched on many of them and came to know most of them r going to scam after looting uSee these projects will never come for trading in any exchange. And they will run away with your money ultimately..So, what I am trying to say is Don't invest blindly in any new projectsU need to research on the project first, what they do, what's  their founders/ co-founders do, their past works etc. This will clearly tell u.. After all its your hard earned money. Don't lose it. ü§ü

Bitcoin dominance is broke through and steadily kept above the 64% range. Seems like we are going to 66% and even more. As is usually the case, altcoins will continue to bleed.However, we still believe that altcoins will see another strong bounce and resume its rally on December to January or earlier. The fundamental reason behind altcoins following Bitcoin is because altcoin prices are typically measured in Bitcoin... This symbiotic relationship means that the value of different altcoins is often tied to Bitcoin.https://www.tradingview.com/x/L6jzymiH/

Pump result : Around 200 btc traded with a 21.5% profit peak. It peaked multiple times 3 minutes after the signal was sent. Liquidity is very low right now we believe that is why it has gone down below 250 after our pump ended.  We hope binance can fix this issue soon and we hope many of you managed to sell at 300.

It held nicely during the first 5 minutes and plenty of profits to be made if you had bought within those first minutes, The main reason we didn't go higher is because of the low liquidity + sell pressure as you can see with those wicks which means without our whales 100 btc buy walls support it would have gone down much easier but we got those issues sorted out for our next one. Our next pump will be guaranteed 50%-100% profit for every single member and we plan to announce our signal in a slightly different way which will give it a more organic growth and give everyone plenty of time the chance to buy at a low price. Stay tuned!

üêù BTC MONTHLY UPDATESo, we have the following situation ‚Äî Bitcoin can easily form a bearish divergence on a monthly chart if the candle closes above the $16400 level. There are two possible options:1. We use the rest of November to pump as high as possible, then divergence will be formed and December would be bearish for Bitcoin that will correct after such a sharp growth2. The price stays below $16400 - $17000 zone by the end of the month, then December would be bullish and Bitcoin will grow with almost no correction during the whole monthLink to the TradingView idea: https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/nF3VfMJ6-BTC-MONTHLY-UPDATE/

üí≠ P.S As you know, $INJ is the Binance IEO coin. At the moment it trades much lower than its private sale price that was $1.8. It means that close to CZ people are in -80% loss. Inappropriately for a person who cares that much about his reputation. More likely we will see its pump to at least $1.8 level.

At this moment what BTC is doing we all are loving thisbut this is going parabolic kind of pump again just like 2017 without any correction.u know whats gonna happen once we get to the top, a major correction.But for the time being btc is getting so much bullish. it has broken all major weekly and monthly resistance.The next weekly resistance is $ 17200if we get to see a breakout of this level then 20k will be next stop for sureBut speaking from experience what I observed is correction is what makes the next legup bull more stronger, what BTC is not doing...Hope u understood the point

üêù BTC UPDATEWe are extremely high. At the moment the price is $18200. A few hours ago we could witness a huge "scam wick", but taking another look at this candle, we understand that it was a simple re-test of the historical $17178 level and now it acts as a strong support. Only 10% of the price movement set us apart from the new ATH. We expect to see a continuation of the upward movements today. Bought some Bitcoins below $18000 with the purpose of selling them near $20000.

BREAKING: Bitcoin is coming to Elrond!We have started working with Poly Network to integrate the Elrond mainnet into a network of protocols. Poly Network is building an interoperability layer between blockchains such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Neo, Ontology, and Cosmos, with Elrond joining next.This will enable Bitcoin to circulate on Elrond at internet scale & cost, and the myriads of ERC20 DeFi tokens to benefit from 30% royalties on smart contracts and inexpensive high-speed token transfers.‚ÄúWe are building Elrond to be the internet-scale blockchain. That means throughput on par with the performance needs of the internet, as well as interoperability with the most widely adopted networks.  Beyond performance, Interoperability becomes the most important component for Elrond.‚Äù said Beniamin Mincu, Elrond CEO.Poly Network is an interoperability protocol that is designed to enable digital assets to flow between multiple blockchains. It already connects Bitcoin, Ethereum, Neo, Ontology, and Cosmos. To date, it has processed $2.8 billion dollars in transactions executed in Bitcoin, USDT, Ethereum, and other stable coins & tokens.üëâüèª Read more: https://elrond.com/blog/bitcoin-on-elrond-interoperability-poly-network/Retweet: https://twitter.com/ElrondNetwork/status/1331272562983186446?s=20

üìà BITCOIN REPEAT ITSELF Bitcoin repeats its spring pattern. We've made a clear chart, but here is the step-by-step text explanation:1. Formation of a parabolic up-trend with strong ascending support.2. Breakout of the support and a small consolidation below the one.3. Price rollback above the support to the previous values. 4. Sharp pump above the strong horizontal resistance ($10k that time, $20k now) with only one purpose - trigger stop losses.5. And sharp dump back below the horizontal level in order to consolidate more. The similarity is astonishing! Moreover, altcoins act in the same way, the next post will explain this topic.  At the current time we're at the third step. Link to the TradingView idea: https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/AU4jxgbo-BITCOIN-REPEAT-ITSELF/

üßê WHEN ALTCOIN SEASON?Before reading this post, please take a look at the post aboveWe already remembered what happened with Bitcoin in May 2020, but what was happening with altcoins? They were bleeding. Classical case, when Bitcoin moves in a hard way ‚Äî altcoins suffer. But after the fifth step (from the previous post), altcoin season has started.We expect the same now. Firstly breakout of $20k, rollback below this level and consolidation below it. This will be a great time for altcoins. This winter will definitely be good for alts!

$BTC All Exchanges Inflow Mean(7d MA) hit the eight-month high since March when the price hit the year-low. Whales benefit from retail investors.Ironically, if you see the low time frame, the Exchange Inflow Mean is a bullish signal. Whales are depositing to exchanges, but they don't sell $BTC. The time they sell coins is when retail investors are active on exchanges.Very bullish in the long-run.

MahaDAO‚Äôs strategic use of meta transactions is a strong synergy with Elrond and will be natively supported by our protocol.‚ÄúOur mission is to create the technological and economical infrastructure that will help bring native digital money to its natural conclusion. eGold is a strong contender for becoming base currency and complementary with MahaDAO‚Äôs vision of creating timeless value-stable money.‚Äù said Beniamin Mincu, Elrond CEO.Read more: https://elrond.com/blog/mahadao-arth-stable-coin-on-elrond

1.78 million bitcoins have never left their miner address.That is 9.5% of the circulating #Bitcoin supply.Our analysis shows that 98% of those coins were mined more than 7 years ago, and 94% more than 10 years ago.Most could be lost forever.

Due to the current instability in the market, investing in altcoins at the moment bears very high risk.If you see any calls here, it's better to make smaller investments. A good amount to invest if there is a lot of movement is a maximum of 2% porfolio for each coin and always keep in mind that you need to use stop losses.You can also take some time off trading until trend reversal is confirmed then we will be back stronger!

‚ùóÔ∏èIMPORTANT MESSAGEInvesting in altcoins is extremely dangerous at this moment. Bitcoin is unstable and make massive moves on a daily basis which badly affects alts. The safest strategy is to keep 25% of the deposit in majors ($ETH, $BNB) and divide the rest by 50/50 between USD & Bitcoin. However, if you still want to trade alts, we don't recommend to invest more than 5% of the deposit in a single coin. We put 2% as maximum. Sometimes it is very hard to stay still when the market is extremely active, but first of all trading is about patience and self-control.

We've reached a critical inflection point in bitcoin's adoption curve.A moment wholly unique in the history of markets. How will you know when we're approaching the local top?I will look to two metrics:(and neither one is funding -- funding will be useless if this scenario plays out).... The second is Whale Exchange Ratio.On Gemini exchange: this metric was never wrong in 2020. Gemini whales are #Bitcoin 's secret bellweather.

Unlocking powerful secure governance use cases via the Elrond Multisig ContractAll digital systems will rapidly grow to depend on blockchain as a core technology. Immutable records that are instantly auditable, transactions that double as an invoice, a trustworthy and inexpensive pay-per-use system that runs unattended 24/7, are all very compelling. Elrond Network‚Äôs carefully designed features make it a suitable candidate to support a broad range of digital use cases. One important feature is the capability that allows multiple stakeholders to securely agree on decisions via a multi-signature contract.  Multisig accounts are a critical safety feature for all users of the Elrond ecosystem. The new multisig contract sets a high security standard for decentralized applications, stablecoin issuers, and others who will benefit significantly by using it.You can read more about our Multisig implementation here: https://elrond.com/blog/elrond-multisig-contracts/

‚Äã‚Äãüìç "Profit/Risk Ratio" - what is it and how to use it?Professional traders use the profit/risk ratio to estimate a possible profit in relation to a possible loss. In order to understand how much is the profit/risk ratio, the trader needs to determine both potential profit and potential loss. The potential risk is the difference between the entry point in the position and the stop order. The potential profit is the difference between the entry price and the target order.üîé If you buy Bitcoin at $6900, place a stop order at $6800 and take profit at $7200, the risk will be $100 ($6900 - $ 6800), and the profit will be $300 ($7200 - $6900).Comparing the risk with the possible profit, we get the ratio: risk/profit = $300/$100 = 3If the ratio is bigger than 1.0, it means that the profit is bigger than the potential loss.Why is it useful? üìä Let's use the statistics.The table below shows the dependence of the probability to lose the whole deposit on the accuracy of your trades and the profit/risk ratio in each trade. So, we can see that even if your strategy has only 60% accuracy, but at the same time, the profit/risk ratio is at least 1.5:1, you can already be sure that you will not lose all your money. But if the ratio is 1:1, with the same 60% accuracy, the probability of losing the deposit with a series of unprofitable trades is already 12%.

#Bitcoin dominance approaching local support confluence with diagonal line. There can see a little bounce or/ flat before the further drop. (The other scenario is #BTC dominance goes down straight to 62% would be great.)I would recommend take profits and increase stop losses higher along the way from current trades.We‚Äôll move slow because there could have some new catalyst comes out for Bitcoin, it might do some real altcoins damage in the next week. We‚Äôve always stressed the importance of holding fiat (at least 50%) in your portfolio.We are happy to some previous huge profitable trades and starting to reduce exposure to altcoins, they may need to make adjustments,  when the market correction takes place, it can actually be a positive to catch some better entries on a handful of high potential coins. We maybe making less trades and taking more long term investments if that‚Äôs what the market calls for.You should have an approach that allows you to adjust to market conditions and be prepared for multiple scenarios, since trading is about to manage the odds of the different scenarios.We're not calling the bear market, we are just reduce exposure to altcoins and to catch some better entries on a handful of high potential coins.https://www.tradingview.com/x/nECg93f6/

Think we're safe from $BTC whale dumping for now.Looking at All Exchanges Inflow Mean(144-block MA), if the price goes up and this indicator hits 2 BTC, the price would likely be bearish or going sideways.This indicator doesn't work when there's institutional spot inflow since it only checks out on-chain whale moving. Institutional buying overrides whale dumping.

However, Ethereum has time only until 8th February, cause at this day CME Group Launches ETH Futures. They will SHORT the top. At the same time the price has formed a big ascending channel. There are two options:1. Flat between $1350 - $1450 for the next 7 - 10 days, then breakout. Target would be $1750 - $1850.2. Breakout of the $1450 at this week and consolidation above $1700. Target would be above $2000.

Today's pump was very good. Our members dumped the outsiders after 1 minute and then bought more coin cheaper when the outsiders panicked. Thanks to your support, and more specifically, sharing our pump and the group in social media, our pump was successful. We plan to organize much bigger pumps in the future. In the future, we also want to organize ranked pumps from time to time, in which you will be able to get ranks that will give you a time advantage, for inviting your friends to our discord server.‚û°Ô∏è https://t.me/CrypticPumps‚û°Ô∏è https://discord.gg/vnzpdBtCXz

Regular users typically don‚Äôt manage digital document verification processes on their own, and therefore are not able to complete a cryptocurrency purchase. Thanks to Ramp‚Äôs innovative passthrough KYC method, this important class of users can now buy eGold as easily as if they were shopping online.‚ÄúBy efficiently traversing one of the most common hurdles for first time adopters, Ramp Network will accelerate and streamline the inflow of new users into the Elrond ecosystem.‚Äù said Beniamin Mincu, Elrond CEO.You can now select Ramp Network as on-ramp for purchasing eGold by accessing https://buy.elrond.com

Band‚Äôs decentralized oracles are checking the accuracy of the data and then sending it to the Elrond Network. They will be deployed to our mainnet soon after January 26, when the Smart Contracts deployment feature will be activated.‚ÄúWorking alongside Elrond has confirmed what is immediately apparent from the clarity, logic, and attention to detail present in their code and tools - their mission is to help others build.‚Äù said Soravis Srinawakoon, Band Protocol CEO.#hypergrowth100 Day 18 Read more: https://elrond.com/blog/band-oracles-live-elrond-devnetRetweet: https://twitter.com/ElrondNetwork/status/1352572046547542016?s=20

Elrond and Binance Smart Chain integration to enable strategic DeFi interoperabilityThe opportunity of an interoperable DeFi ecosystem is far greater than the sum of separate individual parts. Specific opportunities enabled by the unique capabilities of distinct blockchains are amplified by the seamless flow of value and global user accessibility.We are therefore excited to announce that the Elrond Network will be interoperable with the Binance Smart Chain. This will allow the free flow of assets issued on one chain to participate in DeFi opportunities on the other chain.‚ÄúThe integration with the Binance Smart Chain is meant to significantly increase exposure, accessibility, and value flow between the networks, enabling many creative opportunities for the DeFi ecosystem.‚Äù said Beniamin Mincu, Elrond CEO.The first step of the integration has already been made. eGold can be withdrawn from the Binance CEX as BEP20 EGLD tokens on the Binance Smart Chain. The ongoing collaboration is now focused on enabling the transfer of tokens in a direct manner via a bridge. #hypergrowth100 Day 21 Read more: http://elrond.com/blog/elrond-binance-smart-chain-defi-interoperability

Listing on Binance is just a matter of time? Good question. The zone between $0.036 - $0.046 is good for buying.

‚Äã‚Äãü§î Does the accuracy of signals really matter?Yes, but not that much. There are a lot of Telegram Channels that shouting about their 95% accuracy from every ravine, while in fact their members can be in total loss. Why? Because you can close 5 profitable trades in a raw, but stay in loss because the only one trade that was closed by a Stop Loss. Risk and Money managment - this is the most important thing in trading, not the accuracy.My personal advise: when you choose between a number of channels, look at: the Reward/Risk (RR) ratio, % of the deposit a trader advises you to invest in each trade, and only after this check accuracy of signals. If there are too much profitable trades - check the distance between the avg. entry price and a stop loss. Hope that this text was useful for you.

Expect to see a reversal downwards from the $41000 - $42000 zone. But anyway the main thing here is where the price takes hold.

‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄºÔ∏è IMPORTANT MARKET UPDATE1. Bitcoin looks extremely strong and ready for heading upwards. 2. Took profit on ALL altcoins (25% / 75% USDT/BTC) we held.3. We sold even 8/10 of ETH with 75% profit.4. Our bag is 60% BTC, 30% USDT and 10% ETH. Nothing more. üìä OUR PLAN: Holding altcoins became very risky, some of them can pump but the main season is over for now. We will wait for the weekly closure, then will decide either we sell the main part of Bitcoins into USDT or keep holding the majority of the funds in BTC. üí≠ P.S We just expressed our plan and thoughts. We can be wrong. Everyone has to make their own decisions when it comes to such important things.

Therefore, we have a horizontal channel where the price will most likely fluctuate for some time before going downwards. Why we think that $1420 will be broken downwards? Institutionals on CME will SHORT the top on #ETH after Futures will be launched. Mid-term idea.

‚ùóÔ∏èü¶ã IMPORTANT ETH UPDATEWe bought back 50% of Ether we sold at $1700. Why we did this? 1. Yesterday we saw a sharp correction but the previous ATH level wasn't reached. It means that the massive part of buy orders didn't reach, because the target is going upwards.2. The 12H candle formed a Hammer pattern and closed above the strong ascending trend line. 3. Funding rate is negative which is very good for holding LONGs.Summary: we're staying away from discussions about CME and their positions. Time will show. For now we see a clear opportunity from the market ‚Äî buy #ETH at $1600 and sell it near $2000. We will take it.

2 hours left!- We will be using the BTC pairing on Binance.com to pump - When you buy the coin and it's time to sell, never sell on the buy supports! Instead sell slowly in parts as the price goes up. - Our pump will have many waves as our whales will actively be buying with our members to support the price, there will be a lot of possibilities to make profits many times during the pump!- After buying, we highly suggest to place buy orders below the market price as the price moves up.
